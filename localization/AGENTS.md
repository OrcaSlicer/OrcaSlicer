# Localization rules

Applies to this directory. Repository paths in the rules below are relative to the Git root. These rules were moved verbatim from the root AGENTS.md.

## Localization & translations

Catalogs live in `localization/i18n/<lang>/OrcaSlicer_<lang>.po`; the template is `OrcaSlicer.pot`.
See the [Localization guide](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer_WIKI/blob/main/guides/localization_guide.md) for the human-facing version of these principles.

### Terminology

- Use the [Localization glossary](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer_WIKI/blob/main/guides/localization_glossary.md) as the source of truth for recurring terms, so the same English term is always rendered the same way within a language, and terms that must stay in English (brand/product names, acronyms, materials, file formats, G-code tokens, macros/variables/identifiers) are not translated.
- If a term's established translation changes, update both the affected `.po` files and the glossary (`localization_glossary.tsv`, then regenerate) so they stay in sync.
- Translate the *meaning*, not the words. Check what the string actually controls before translating it — English reuses one word for different things. `Flow ratio` (multiplier), `Flow Rate` (throughput) and `Flow Dynamics` (pressure compensation) are three different terms; `extruder` may mean the toolhead, the feeder motor, or the nozzle depending on the string.
- Reuse one template per recurring message shape (`Failed to connect to …`, `Are you sure you want to …?`), even where the English wording varies.

### Editing rules

- Only edit `msgstr` — **never** change `msgid`, and never "fix" wrong English in the translation alone. Report the source string instead.
- Preserve exactly: placeholders (`%s`, `%d`, `%1%`, `%zu`, `%%`), every `\n` (count *and* position, including leading/trailing), leading/trailing spaces, HTML tags, `℃`, and the file's encoding and line endings.
- **Never reorder positional arguments** in a `c-format` string. If the msgid is `%d` then `%s`, that order must hold — swapping them breaks at runtime.
- `msgctxt` separates homonyms — always read it. `Back`/`Camera View` is the rear view of the 3D navigator, while `Back`/`Navigation` is the go-back button; `Top` exists in the *Alignment*, *Layers* and *Camera View* senses.
- When a string needs disambiguating, add context in the source (`_L_CONTEXT`/`_u8L_CONTEXT`), don't work around it in the translation.
- A literal `%` inside a string xgettext flagged `possible-c-format` will fail `msgfmt`. Fix it with a `// xgettext:no-c-format, no-boost-format` comment above the string in the source — do not mangle the translation or use `%%` in text that is never passed through printf.
- Plural entries: read `nplurals` from the catalog's `Plural-Forms` header (it is **not** always 2 — ja/ko/zh/th/vi use 1, ru/cs/pl/lt use 3, uk uses 4). Each form must be genuinely inflected for its quantity; repeating one sentence across all forms is a bug in Slavic/Baltic languages, though it is correct for Turkish and Hungarian.
- An entry whose `msgstr` equals its `msgid` is untranslated even though it is not empty; a plural entry with any empty form is likewise incomplete.
- Mark machine-produced translations with an `# AI Translated` translator comment. Don't add it to a human translation you didn't actually rewrite.
- Don't reflow or re-wrap unrelated entries — keep the diff limited to the strings you changed.

### Verifying

- `scripts/run_gettext.bat --full` (Windows) regenerates the template, merges every catalog and compiles the `.mo` files. It must exit 0.
- Or check a single catalog with `msgfmt --check-format -o <out>.mo localization/i18n/<lang>/OrcaSlicer_<lang>.po`.
- Fuzzy entries are not shown to users. If you correct one, clear its `fuzzy` flag, otherwise the fix never ships.
